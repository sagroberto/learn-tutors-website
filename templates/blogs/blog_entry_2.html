                    Lifelong Learners
                </h1>
                <p>Recently I was teaching a literature class and one of the assignments was about a TedTalk video.
                    Whether you are an ESL student or an English student, TedTalks will cross your way quite often,
                    mostly because they are filled with outstanding, awe-striking stories about any subject you can
                    think of. I use them in my lessons and I suggest you do too.</p>

                <p>Going back on track, the central question of the course was “What does it mean to be a Lifelong
                    Learner” It actually made me think about how a lifelong learner is the perfect description of an
                    educator. We are constantly seeking more knowledge not just to be better than our students, but also
                    because I do not know a single educator who is not curious by nature, most of us, bookworms for
                    sure, but also polyglots, researchers, and entrepreneurs. We are a dangerous breed for modern
                    educational systems in which the governments ought to keep you in line with the needs of society,
                    thinkers are revolts, and revolts bring change. Wow, I guess I have watched Matilda the Musical way
                    too many times, by the way, I’m talking about it in my next post. </p>

                <p>In this way, the speaker states, "Education is not about filling buckets; it is lighting fires." To
                    paraphrase the quote, education is about more than cramming facts into students' heads; it's about
                    igniting a passion for knowledge. Hence, the questions you should ask when trying to find a tutor
                    are:</p>

                <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>I encouraged to LEARN?</li>
                    <li>Am I having fun while learning?</li>
                    <li>Has my sparkle for curiosity ignited?</li>
                </ul>
                </p>

                <p></p>Anyhow, here’s the Ted Talk, take a look:</p>

                <h4>ESL LEARNers' Word Challenge:</h4>

                <p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Bumbling around →</strong> Comportarse de forma despistada y desorganizada, cometiendo errores y, por lo
                        general, sin conseguir nada.</li>
                    <li><strong>Bumping into →</strong> encontrarse por casualidad o inesperadamente</li>
                    <li><strong>Figure out →</strong> resolver un problema o descubrir la respuesta a una pregunta.</li>
                    <li><strong>Reliable →</strong> de confianza</li>
                    <li><strong>Farting around →</strong> perder el tiempo: pasar el tiempo haciendo actividades que no tienen ningún
                        propósito serio.</li>
                    <li><strong>Exhilarating →</strong> Emocionante</li>
                    <li><strong>Collect data and facts →</strong> (false cognate) esta palabra es fácilmente confundida con coleccionar,
                        pero
                        en realidad significa recopilar o recoger.</li>
                    <li><strong>excel at →</strong> ser superior de alguna forma; superar en logros o resultados.</li>
                </ul>
